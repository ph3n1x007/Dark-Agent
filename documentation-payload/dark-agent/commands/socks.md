# SOCKS Implementation

This document details the SOCKS proxy implementation in Dark Agent, explaining the data flow, components, and optimization opportunities.

## Overview

The SOCKS implementation in Dark Agent provides a SOCKS5-compliant proxy that enables secure tunneling of TCP connections through the agent. This allows operators to access remote network resources through the agent's network context.

## Command Usage

```
socks <port> [start|stop]
```

- `port`: The local port on the Mythic server to start the SOCKS proxy on
- `action`: Optional parameter, either "start" (default) or "stop"

Example:
```
socks 1080
```

        A
    end
    
    subgraph "Target Environment"
        B
        C
    end
    
    subgraph "Client Tools"
        D[Browser/Curl/etc.] --> E[Local SOCKS Port]
    end
    
    E --> A
```

## Detailed Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client Tool
    participant Mythic as Mythic Server
    participant Agent as Dark Agent
    participant Target as Target Service

    Client->>Mythic: Connect to SOCKS port
    Mythic->>Agent: SOCKS handshake request
    Note over Agent: SocksHandler processes request
    Note over Agent: Creates SocksClient instance
    Agent->>Target: TCP connection
    Agent->>Mythic: SOCKS handshake response
    
    loop Data Transfer
        Client->>Mythic: Data via SOCKS
        Mythic->>Agent: Base64-encoded data
        Note over Agent: SocksClient decodes data
        Agent->>Target: Raw data
        
        Target->>Agent: Response data
        Note over Agent: SocksClient encodes data
        Agent->>Mythic: Base64-encoded response
        Mythic->>Client: Raw response data
    end
    
    Client->>Mythic: Close connection
    Mythic->>Agent: Exit flag = true
    Agent->>Target: Close connection
```

## Internal Component Architecture

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class SocksHandler {
        -clients: Map<Int, SocksClient>
        +handle_datagram(datagram: JSON)
        +instance(): SocksHandler
    }
    
    class SocksClient {
        -target: TCPSocket
        -active: bool
        -server_id: Int
        +handle_data(data: String)
        +close()
        -process_handshake(data: Bytes)
        -read_from_target(socket: TCPSocket)
        -send_data(data: Bytes)
        -send_data_immediate(data: Bytes)
    }
    
    class MessageHandler {
        -responses: Array
        -commands: Array
        -socks_queue: Channel
        -socks_messages: Array
        -connection_types: Map<Int, Int>
        +add_socks_data(server_id, data, exit)
        +add_socks_direct(server_id, data, exit)
        +prepare_response()
        -ensure_socks_processor()
    }
    
    class Transport {
        +send_responses()
        +receive_tasks()
    }
    
    SocksHandler "1" --* "many" SocksClient
    SocksClient --> MessageHandler: adds messages
    MessageHandler --> Transport: sends data
    Transport --> SocksHandler: receives datagrams
```

## Optimization Points

The current SOCKS implementation has several areas for optimization:

### High-Performance Messaging

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SocksClient] -->|add_socks_data| B[MessageHandler]
    A -->|add_socks_direct| B
    B -->|socks_queue| C[SOCKS Processor]
    C -->|batch messages| D[Transport]
    D -->|HTTP/HTTPS| E[Mythic Server]
```

1. **Batching System**:
   - Messages are batched based on connection type
   - Interactive connections (small packets) are sent more frequently
   - Large transfers use bigger batches for efficiency

2. **Thread Safety**:
   - Uses mutex for thread-safe operations
   - Channel-based queue for high throughput

### Socket Optimizations

The implementation includes several socket-level optimizations:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[SocksClient] -->|sets| B[TCP_NODELAY]
    A -->|increases| C[Buffer Sizes]
    A -->|enables| D[Keep-Alive]
    A -->|uses| E[Direct Send Path]
```

1. **Socket Configuration**:
   - TCP_NODELAY: Disabled Nagle's algorithm for better interactivity
   - Larger buffers (256KB) for better throughput
   - Socket keep-alive for maintaining connections

2. **Handling Different Traffic Types**:
   - Interactive mode: Optimized for responsiveness (small packets)
   - Large transfer mode: Optimized for throughput (larger batches)

## Implementation Details

### Data Processing

1. **Encoding**:
   - All SOCKS data is Base64 encoded for transport over HTTP/HTTPS
   - Adds overhead but ensures compatibility with HTTP transport

2. **Transport Layer**:
   - HTTP polling-based communication
   - Large payloads (>256KB or >5 messages) use async non-blocking sends

3. **Message Processing**:
   - Thread-safe operations with mutex synchronization
   - Background fiber processes data every 1ms
   - Batching system for efficient data transmission

## Technical Details

### Protocol Constants and Enums

The SOCKS implementation supports SOCKS5 with the following features:

- Address types: IPv4, IPv6, and FQDN (domain names)
- Commands: Connect (supported), Bind and Associate (not implemented)
- Reply codes: Full RFC1928 compliant response codes

### Data Encoding

- All SOCKS data is Base64 encoded for transport over HTTP/HTTPS
- Initial connection request includes target information (IP:port)
- Data messages contain raw socket data (encoded)
- Exit messages signal connection termination

### Thread Model

- SOCKS processing occurs in multiple Fibers (Crystal's lightweight threads)
- Separate Fibers handle:
  - Initial connection processing
  - Reading from target sockets
  - Data batch processing
  - Keep-alive maintenance

### Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

- Socket timeouts with retry mechanism
- Connection errors with appropriate SOCKS reply codes
- Resource cleanup on connection termination

## Conclusion

The SOCKS implementation in Dark Agent provides a functional and reliable SOCKS5 proxy capability with support for IPv4, IPv6, and domain name resolution. The implementation handles connection pooling, efficient data batching, and robust error handling to provide a stable proxy service for accessing remote network resources through the agent.
