## Summary

Performs TCP port scanning against specified targets to discover open services.

The `portscan` command conducts network reconnaissance by testing connectivity to specified ports on target systems. This is essential for lateral movement planning and network service discovery.

## Arguments

- **target** (string, required): IP address, hostname, or CIDR network range
- **ports** (string, required): Comma-separated port list or ranges (e.g., "22,80,443" or "1-1000")

## Usage

```bash
# Single host, specific ports
portscan 192.168.1.10 22,80,443,3389

# Network range, common ports  
portscan 10.0.1.0/24 21,22,23,25,53,80,110,135,139,443,445,993,995

# Single host, port range
portscan 192.168.1.50 1-1000

# Multiple specific hosts
portscan 192.168.1.1 80,443
portscan 192.168.1.2 80,443
portscan 192.168.1.3 80,443
```

## Output Format

```bash
portscan 192.168.1.10 22,80,443,3389
```

**Open Ports Found:**
```
Port Scan Results for 192.168.1.10:
22/tcp   open    ssh
80/tcp   open    http
443/tcp  open    https

## Network Discovery Scenarios

**Initial Network Reconnaissance:**
```bash
# Discover web services
portscan 10.0.0.0/8 80,443,8080,8443

# Discover SSH access
portscan 172.16.0.0/12 22

# Mail server discovery
portscan 192.168.0.0/16 25,110,143,993,995

# Management interface discovery
portscan 172.16.1.0/24 8080,9090,8443,9443
```

## Technical Details

- **Implementation**: Custom object file module with socket programming
- **Performance**: Concurrent scanning for faster results
- **Timeouts**: Configurable connection timeouts (default: 3 seconds)
- **Background Execution**: Runs as background job for large scans

## Security Considerations

**Detection Risk:**
- **Network Logging**: Connections may be logged by firewalls/IDS
- **Service Logs**: Failed connections logged by target services  
- **Timing**: Rapid consecutive connections may trigger alerts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sequential port scans have distinctive patterns

**Stealth Options:**
```bash
# Smaller ranges to avoid detection
portscan 192.168.1.10 80,443
# Instead of: portscan 192.168.1.10 1-65535

# Target specific services
portscan 192.168.1.0/24 22
# Instead of: portscan 192.168.1.0/24 1-1000
```

## Performance Considerations

**Large Network Scans:**
```bash
# This will take significant time and create many connections:
portscan 10.0.0.0/8 1-1000
# Consider smaller ranges or specific ports
```

**Background Job Management:**
```bash
# Start scan
portscan 192.168.0.0/16 80,443

# Check progress
jobs

# Kill if needed
jobkill 1
```
