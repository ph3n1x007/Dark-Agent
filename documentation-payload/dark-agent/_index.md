## Summary

Dark Agent is a production-ready Mythic Agent designed for Linux and MacOS systems. Built in Crystal language, it provides comprehensive remote operations capabilities through dynamic module loading, extensive system commands, and flexible communication options. All network communications use statically-linked OpenSSL for maximum compatibility.

### Core Features

**Agent Architecture:**
- Written in Crystal language for optimal performance
- Static OpenSSL linking (self-contained binary)
- Support for Linux and macOS systems
- Multi-threading for module execution and SOCKS handling

**Communication:**
- HTTP and HTTPX (malleable) communication profiles with domain rotation
- AES-256-CBC encryption with HMAC authentication
- Configurable symmetric jitter for operational security
- Realtime mode for interactive operations
- SOCKS proxy support for network pivoting

**Command Capabilities:**
- Dynamic module loading and execution with extensive built-in Unix commands
- File upload/download with configurable chunk sizes
- Job management (background task execution)
- Dynamic command loading/unloading
- Comprehensive system information gathering

**Built-in Commands:**
- **System Commands**: ps, kill, df, mounts, netstat, routes, uptime, whoami, hostname, env
- **File Operations**: cat, rm, chmod, chown, timestomp, ls
- **Network Tools**: arp, ifconfig, nslookup, portscan, shell
- **Agent Management**: bof_exec, bof_load, bof_list, bof_unload, download, upload, jobs, jobkill, sleep, exit

## Building

### Build Options

Dark Agent provides several build options to customize the payload for your specific needs:

```bash
# Build everything (default) - agent + BOFs with static OpenSSL
./build.sh

# Build only BOFs 
./build.sh -b

# Build debug version (verbose logging)
./build.sh -d

# Build release version (optimized)
./build.sh -r

# Build SOCKS debug version
./build.sh -S

# Specify communication profile type
./build.sh -p http     # Build with HTTP profile (default)
./build.sh -p httpx    # Build with HTTPX profile (malleable)
```

**Build Features:**
- **Static OpenSSL**: All builds include statically-linked OpenSSL for maximum compatibility
- **No Dependencies**: Resulting binary runs on any Linux/macOS system without external libraries
- **Automatic Module Compilation**: Built-in Unix commands compiled during build process
- **Multi-threading Support**: Module execution and SOCKS proxy handling use separate threads

### Build Parameters

When creating a payload in Mythic, you can configure the following build parameters:

**Security & Performance:**
- **debug_mode** (Boolean, default: false) - Enables verbose logging to stdout, useful for troubleshooting agent issues  
- **debug_socks** (Boolean, default: false) - Enables SOCKS proxy debug logging for network troubleshooting
- **disable_encryption** (Boolean, default: false) - Disables AES-256-CBC encryption for communications (testing only)
- **disable_ssl_verify** (Boolean, default: true) - Disables SSL certificate validation for development environments

**Communication Behavior:**
- **symmetric_jitter** (Boolean, default: false) - Uses symmetric jitter ranging from (sleep_time ± jitter%) for better operational security
- **realtime** (Boolean, default: false) - Immediately sends pending command responses without waiting for sleep interval
- **chunk_size** (Number, default: 512) - Size of file transfer chunks in KB, affects upload/download performance

### Debugging

The debug build provides detailed logging to help with troubleshooting:

1. **Debug Mode**: When enabled (either with `-d` flag or `debug_mode: true` in Mythic):
   - Detailed logging messages are sent to stdout
   - Network requests/responses are logged
   - Internal agent operations are traced
   - Error messages include more context

2. **To build in debug mode**:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh -d -p http   # Debug build with HTTP profile
   ./build.sh -d -p httpx  # Debug build with HTTPX profile
   ```

3. **Running in debug mode**:
   ```bash
   ./output/dark-agent-debug
   ```

Debug output includes:
- Communication profile initialization
- Request/response details
- Module loading and execution
- Encryption/decryption operations
- Command processing
- Task handling
- File transfer operations

The debug output is essential for developing and testing custom modules, troubleshooting connectivity issues, or diagnosing problems with malleable profiles.
